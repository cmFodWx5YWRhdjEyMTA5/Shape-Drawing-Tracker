# Shape Drawing Tracker

As I decided to learn how to draw, I have to practice on drawing the basics shapes everyday and finding the right balance is complicated.

What to practice? How much time? Keeping track of my progress prove itself to be a real struggle.

Then, I had an idea: 

>What if I could create a simple App to determine what I should practice on? It shouldn't be hard after all!

And...here we are!

### First working version demo (v1.0-spark)

**This application is a simple way for me to apply what I've learn so far in Android. This is also the first App that I write using exclusively Kotlin** 

## First Draft

Here is a quick mock up that I made:

## Key Features

At his most straightforward version, this App should allow the user to select a list of shape among a predifined pool and randomize it.
