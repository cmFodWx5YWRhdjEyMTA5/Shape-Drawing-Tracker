# Shape Drawing Tracker

As I decided to learn how to draw, I have to practice on drawing the basics shapes everyday and finding the right balance is complicated.

What to practice? How much time? Keeping track of my progress prove itself to be a real struggle.

Then, I had an idea: 

>What if I could create an App that take care of everything? It shouldn't be hard after all!

And...here we are!

## First Draft

Here is a quick mock up that I made:

## Key Features

At his most straightforward version, this App should let the user:

 - Randomly generate a shape among an editable list for the user to draw 
 - Allow to select all / nothing
 - Save the list for future usages
  
## More Advanced Features
Once the basics are implemented we could: 
 - Allow the user to create his own custom shape
 - Allow the user to classify the shapes into categories and favorite
 - Add a Stats Activity to track what shape has been practiced the most with a calendar to display the day when the user has used the tool or not
